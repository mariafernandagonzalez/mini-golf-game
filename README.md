# Full-Stack Mini Golf Game
Hello Golf! is a browser-based mini golf game by implementing physics-based motion, obstacle interactions, and collision detection. I collaborated with 2 peers to deliver a functional prototype in 3 weeks. The game utilizes click and drag functionality as the player moves closer to the goal. Powerups are collected and used via keyboard commands, with obstacles integrated into the course.
